# Introduction

Gun violence is a critical issue in the United States. Be it gang violence, home invasions or school shootings, the news is full of it. The debate surrounding this issue often revolves around whether the right to bear arms, as enshrined in the Second Amendment, is the primary cause, or whether socio-economic factors such as poverty and lack of education play a more significant role. This data-driven story aims to explore these perspectives in detail, using extensive datasets to uncover patterns and correlations that can shed light on the multifaceted nature of gun violence.

For this datastory we have chosen two perspectives that we will substantiate. One of those being that the right to keep and bear arms as stated in the second amendment is the underlying cause for the disproportionate amount of gun related crimes and incidents. The way to resolve this would either be to enforce much stricter gun laws or to take the right to own guns away entirely. 
While the other perspective takes a different approach to solving the ongoing crisis, that is, taking away people's right to own guns wonâ€™t solve the issue of violence. Desperate people will find substitutes for guns to continue carrying out violence. That is why the focus should be put on trying to eradicate the problem at the root, we should be looking into socio-economic factors like poverty and education.

We will utilize a dataset consisting of nearly 240,000 recorded gun violence incidents from January 2013 to March 2018, providing detailed information on each event. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to identify geographic patterns of gun violence across the United States, examining factors such as the severity of incidents and their frequency in relation to state-level gun laws. Additionally, we will explore socio-economic datasets to investigate the relationship between poverty rates, the unemployment and the incidence of gun violence per state, seeking to understand whether economic hardship correlates with higher levels of gun-related crimes. 

On the other hand we are going to argue that there should be heavy restrictions enforced on the Second Amendment. First of all, a common occurrence in America are school shootings. School shootings, a tragic manifestation of violence in educational settings, have become a significant concern worldwide. These incidents not only disrupt the educational environment but also cause immeasurable pain and suffering to victims, their families, and communities. This project aims to delve into an in-depth analysis of school shootings, exploring their frequency. Children and students are the very future of the world and should not be afraid of losing their lives, especially in the places designated for studying. Furthermore, we could compare Europe with America to argue that freedom of gun usage in America alone is extraordinary and very concerning. By examining these aspects, we hope to provide compelling arguments for stricter gun control laws or even the prohibition of firearms.

To visualize the results of our study we will include choropleth maps to highlight states with their levels of gun violence and poverty, we will also make use of scatter plots to illustrate the correlation, if any, between the chosen variables. With these visual tools, we will present a clear picture of the landscape of gun violence in the U.S., aiming to provide insights into the potential causes and contributing factors behind this pressing issue.

By the end of this data story, we hope to offer a nuanced understanding of gun violence in America, highlighting the complex relationship between constitutional rights and socio-economic conditions, and providing a foundation for informed discussions on potential solutions to reduce gun-related deaths.
